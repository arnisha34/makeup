This Website was created as a challenge to show my design and development skills while utilizing a public API.  Enjoy!

### Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) (necessary for the project to work).

- make sure once the project is downloaded and placed in your ide of choice you do a npm i or npm install to download the necessary dependencies
needed for the project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JS with syntax for types
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Development environment
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) - Testing environment
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) - IDE

### What I learned

TypeScript is both a blessing and a curse at times lol!!!
Cleaner code = less comments needed over time
Learning how to test my code is a challenge but definitely worth the knowledge that's to be gained 

### Continued development

- Add node.js to handle stripe.js api for payment testing
- Finish building the rest of the components to make this a full blown E-commerce site
- Add tests using vitest

### Useful resources

- [Makeup API](http://makeup-api.herokuapp.com)) - The API used for the site which gave me plenty of data to manipulate.
